"By the way, this method only makes sense if you need to use Terminal Services in Application Mode, which is the one that requires licensing."  
  
Dude, there's only one terminal services installation now, on windows 2003. You no longer have the choice of app or admin. Duh!

It works for everyone. Obviously the file is created again, but open the terminal services license manager and see that your license leases are blank.  
  
Don't forget to delete those from the clients registry.

OK I deleted the registry entry from one of the client PCs and renamed TSLIC.edb to tslic.old and I restarted the server (I had no choice of not restarting cause I had to go into Safe Mode in order to rename that file) but still no luck  
  
do I have to delete those registry entries on every PC in the network?  
  
and what should I do if I'm trying to rdesktop from a linux box?

[Anonymous]( "noreply@blogger.com") - <time datetime="2006-07-26T04:06:00.000-07:00">Jul 3, 2006</time>

OK, I deleted the registry entry from one of the client PCs and renamed the TSLIC.edb to tslib.old (its size is 1032KB) but when I go back to Normal Mode the file is being created obviously the same (exactly the same size) even though I had plugged the server out from the network so it cannot obtain it from the other PCs  
  
How does TS recognize the devices anyway? It's not by their MAC address, because I tried to spoof it but it didn't work out.  
  
And another thing what should I do if I try to rdesktop from a linux box?  
  
Anyone can help?  
  
Thanks a lot in advance, guys!

Hi Yves and everybody,  
  
It is possible to create a batch program like DOS batch to rename the file and restart the server automaticly every 2,1/2 months (in windows scheduled taks, before expire the license time)?  
  
I belive that in this way it's possible even to delete without have to enter in safe mode...  
  
Does anyone have a clue how to do that?  
  
Thanks!

Many thanks. It really works, even with server2003! And it's easier than to reinstall the whole server from scratch as I did the last time (120 days ago...).  
But the easiest way to do is to desinstall and reinstall TSE after 110 days without waiting the 120th day.

To delete or rename the TSLic.ebd, you dont need to boot into safe mode or reboot at all. Just go into "Services" and stop the "Terminal Services Licensing" service. Then after you rename/delete TSLic.ebd, restart the service.

or you could just find the old beta app called reset5 be warned though you cannot update windows once this is installed and the server would require a reboot every 30 days but it will stop the licensing issues  
  
so basically if you dont have internet enabled apps etc you could put reset 5 on but at your own risk if you already have updates on the server then DO NOT USE RESET 5
<hr />
#### So, reset5 is not really useful, then?

On w2kadvanced, here is all you have to do (edit the delete path in this script for your particular edb file) If you are using thin clients like a 2x server then the clients don't even have to logoff.  
  
Create a .bat file containing the following:  
  
net stop "Terminal Services Licensing"  
del .\\LServer\\TLSLic.edb  
net start "Terminal Services Licensing"

#### Activate your Terminal License Server first.
[Anonymous]( "noreply@blogger.com") - <time datetime="2007-02-09T04:29:00.000-08:00">Feb 5, 2007</time>

Activate your Terminal License Server first.  
  
To do this  
Go to Terminal Server Licensing/yourserver/activate  
choose the activation method as phone and notice the Product ID  
Go to http://activate.microsoft.com and get the license key by entering Product ID  
  
After you got the License key, disconnect all connection from client.Stop the terminal server licensing service in windows services (Run/services.msc)  
  
Rename the file %WINDIR%\\system32\\lserver\\TSLIC.edb to something as you like  
  
Remove the registry keys at HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\MSLicensing  
  
Restart your Server.  
  
That's All !

Hi Changis, hello from Brazil to Bangladesh,  
  
How are you? :-)  
  
I suggest you to RENAME the "store" key to something else, like "Store.backup". It has the same effect of deleting, but less disruptive.  
  
Then ago ahead and try this in one computer, see what happens.  
  
I believe it should work pretty well.

Dear Yves,  
  
How are you? Hope fine. Today I tryed to follow your steps. But facing some problems to do the things. These are as follows:  
  
1\. In LServer directory: There was no named called TSLIC.edb file  
  
I found the file Named: TLSLic.edb  
  
Then I tryed to rename the File as TLSLIC.old  
  
But, one message showed that  
""" Cannot rename TLSLic. There has been a sharing violation.  
The source or destination file may be in use. """  
  
  
Next I restart the server and tryed to do the same again. But result is the same. Please help me providing the solution immediately.  
  
I'm waiting for your kind reply.  
  
Thanks and best regards,

Hi guys. This is a great help. My question is: where can I go to download the trial software? I have searched and have come up dry.  
I have Windows Server 2003 SP02 installed on my server. I want to get the trial version installed so we can start developing all the relevant processes. The only thing I was able to find were sites to purchase TS CALs.

jajaja, i have other way and it works.  
  
1\. Put the system time to 2020 year for example  
  
2\. Do all the things in order to get the terminal services working, connecting from your remotes clients  
  
3\. Change the system time to actual year  
  
4\. Now you have your license expire date until year 2020 plus 3 months

IMHO your method seem to be too simple, even for microsoft.... so  
1\. set server date to 2022 or something  
2\. install ts service and ts licensing  
3\. reset to correct date  
4\. be happy till 2022...

Hi IRA,  
  
No you should not active the license server. Leave it in the 3-months trial mode and then just clear the license database as I explained.  
  
cheers!

hi all,  
  
I've installed and configured a w2k3 advanced server machine as a terminal server, but I can't find tslic.\* files... The "uninstall and reinstall TS server" method is ok even on w2k3 with sp2? thx!

It's not necessarily about using unlicensed stuff. I actually have a license with MSDN. The problem is you can only do telephone activation of W2K Terminal Services with MSDN. I called the number they said to, and after being punted from person to person in MS for about half an hour (not kidding - they really kept forwarding the call to different people even though I called the exact bloody number they said to for MSDN activations of W2K Terminal Services) I ended up talking to some useless twit in an Indian call centre who could not speak English well enough to be understood and kept asking for a bunch of different numbers without being able to tell me where I should be able to find those numbers. In the end he then forwarded me to some customer support line that was closed. I ended up wasting an hour and a half on these sons-of-bitches at Microsoft without getting \*anywhere\*.

We hve win server 2003 std, R2  
After run out first period of 90 days, I deinstalled TS from server.  
  
1\. restart server  
2\. set server date to 2027 or something  
2\. install ts service and ts licensing, after first client connect, you get temporary licence which expires 2027 + 3 months.  
3\. connect to TS from all computers, you would like to use TS. You can check after this that all clients has temporary licence expiring 2027 (in TS licencing management)  
4\. reset to correct date  
5\. restart server  
be happy till 2027...  
IT WORKS !!!

AS ANONYMOUS SAID (But not so well) you guys are going through all this trouble for nothing.  
  
1\. Windows 2000 Term Serv is FREE you dopes! As long as the client machines connecting are Windows XP Pro or Windows 2000 Workstation. Just activate your license server in Windows 2000 and connect, no problems. Call MS and ask, they will tell you themselves. If you have a Windows 2003 Domain and toss a Windows 2000 Term Serv on there to get the free licenses, you MUST use the Term Serv License on a WINDOWS 2003 Server! You STILL get the Windows 2000 Term Serv free licenses. I have setup 3 companies this way, has worked for years (My, and most peoples common mistake, was using the Term Serv 2000 License server in a 2003 Domain, can't do that.  
  
2\. But for Windows 2003, read this you numbskulls. Just put your friggin Windows 2003 TS License server in PER USER MODE!!!!! That's all  
  
READ  
  
http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/library/9ec31ca4-64bd-49c5-878c-528bd6449b6d1033.mspx?mfr=true  
  
  
God damn you people are friggin stupid as hell. PER USER MODE NEVER EXPIRES but is a breach of the EULA, that's all.  
  
WORKS. No batch files, no hacks, no licenses.

I'm hoping Anonymous poster from 12/22/2007 is correct. He was so nice about it too - he sure showed everyone how smart he is :/  
  
All I know is I have 4 XP Pro machines now connecting to my server after installing TS Licensing service and all is working well, so far. We'll see in 90 days.

It really works! I have 60+ PCS and 4 servers 2003 in a workgroup environment. Install "Terminal Server Licensing" Control Panel -> Add Remove -> Windows Components. Activate it by going to Admin Tools -> Terminal Service Licensing. Follow the procedures, the server will supply you with an ID number, copy it and go to Https://activate.microsoft.com, paste the ID on the site and copy the code on your server, DONE.  
  
Now that you have the "Terminal Service Licensing" running, STOP IT first, otherwise, you WONT´T be able to rename or delete the TSLiC.edb file.  
To find it, go to C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\LServer.  
  
PS.: Before restart the server, go to "Terminal Service Setting" and change the license "per USER".  
  
Reboot, that´s it! Follow it step by step, it works!

I have tried this per user solution and it wont work with my windows 2003 ENT R2 SP2 edition, and I have tried with not upgrading to R2, meaning just enterprise SP2 and it is not working.  
Any luck on some other solutions?  
I haven't find anything free and working on the internet and the CALs are really expensive.

Activate a License Server Automatically  
1\. Click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Terminal Server Licensing.  
2\. In the console tree, expand All servers.  
3\. Right-click the license server that you want to activate, and then click Activate Server. The Terminal Server License Server Activation Wizard starts.  
4\. Click Next.  
5\. On the "Connection method" page, click Automatic connection (recommended) in the Activation method box, and then click Next.  
6\. On the "Company Information" page, type your name, company, and country or region information, and then click Next.  
7\. Specify any other information that you want such as e-mail and company address, and then click Next.  
  
NOTE: The information on this page is optional. Your license server is activated.  
8\. On the "Completing the Terminal Server Activation Wizard" page, do one of the following:  
• To install client license key packs for your license server, click Next. Follow the instructions in the Terminal Server Client Licensing Wizard to install client licenses.  
• To install client license key packs later, click to clear the Start Terminal Server Client Licensing Wizard now check box, and then click Finish.  
9\. Close the Terminal Server Licensing window.

Just a suggestion that a couple Anonymous users pointed out:  
  
Instead of having to restart the server, you can just go to My PC > Manage > Services and Applications > Services, and then locate Terminal Services Licensing. STOP that service, and then you can delete TSLIC.edb without a problem. Right then, START the service again. Go back to every terminal that couldn't connect to the server and delete the Registry key pointed out above. That will take care of the problem without having to restart your server.

Please guys, if you want to use TS just set date to some years ahead, ex. 2010, when you are installing the W2003 OS. After finish the instalation make a connection to TS, after that set back the date. I use this method e works fine.

Rename the file in TSLIC.edb will make the Terminal license service not able to start. Also, using the User mode and Machine mode will have a different result.  
If you do not start the licensing service, you are not able to check when the trial period will going to expired.  
My problem is I have tested many method but never know if this is really work or not? not starting the licensing server still able to use the TS does it means it is already OK?  
No matter what, thanks for everyone.

I was surprised over the weekend that my remote users who use citrix ran into this issue, I was called on my day off asking me why can't I log in. I recently upgraded my win2k citrix machine to win2k3 then to be surprised with this, anyhow I got a file called MSTermLM.exe which I used to run on old win95 machines or xp home machines to have their machine reset. I sent this to my clients who could not log in they ran the file and now they are in for anohter 90 days. I would prefer a better soultion as I need somethign to last permanently. I will try changing to "per user" mode and see if this work, but if you seach the file above this is an easy fix too.

Many users are having trouble here and the answer to most questions lie in a comment above.  
  
When users choose the "Per Device" option, their activation and server licensing become a problem. Going the "Per User" route will be more fruitful.  
  
Why???  
Because, simply put, Microsoft uses a trust system when it comes to per user licensing. Therefore, if you don't have a TS license key for permanent client licenses, connected users should not be thrown off the server.  
  
After activating my Terminal Server, my work is done. Whether or not I apply license keys, in per user mode it shouldn't make any difference. Right now my VM has been running smoothly here and checking the TS licensing MMC, I can see I have unlimited licenses by default with no time frame layed out for expiration. As for 2008 R2, I can't say as they've changed some things, but judging by what I see, it looks to be business as usual.

Just to add for those who are against being licensed properly. I believe Microsoft leaves things like this so:  
1\. Administrators that may not have purchased enough licenses have time to do so. With politics and red tape, buying TS licenses can take some time.  
2\. Most of the users running TS without the proper licensing are most likely students who want to setup one at home or a test lab. My guess is that TS doesn't suffer from much piracy as it is an advanced product and most normal users will have no use for it at home. In the corporate world, buying software is an excepted evil of business, so if anything some companies may have some discrepancies is anything.

Per user licensing is honor system based, just like Windows Server CAL license (the license that lets you use your server as a server)... if an audit is performed and your organization is in violation of licensing, you will be fined, and potentially more.

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TermService\\Parameters\\LicenseServers\\LICSERVERNAME

Welcome to Terminal Services Unlimited.  
  
This document aims to help you get Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 terminal  
services unlimited connections at unlimited time. Please note that this is not crack for  
windows or anythig like that. Nevertheless, to completely prepare your server, I  
recommend that you begin by taking the step by step as it is covered in this document.  
I also recommend that you install, configure terminal services and terminal services  
licensing for running.  
  
I have tested this solution with clients Windows 2000 Pro, Windows XP, Windows 2000  
Server, various Windows 2003 servers and PocketPC and also I have feedback that this is  
also working on thin clients.  
  
Acording to Microsoft it is not ilegal to use terminal server with temporary licenses. There  
is a paragraph that says: " There is no provision in the EULA for accessing a terminal  
server without the appropriate licenses". Get back on my site if you are interested and  
read paragraph in EULA that is covering this question.  
  
Note that I have tested this mode to work only in licensing per device. In order to bypass  
this evaluation period to unlimited licence follow next steps:  
1\. SERVER - Stop the terminal license server in services  
2\. SERVER - Go to the %systemroot%\\windows\\system32\\lserver\\  
3\. SERVER - Backup both files edb.chk and TLSLic.edb in case method fails (microsoft  
holds licence information database in these files)  
4\. SERVER - Delete both files edb.chk and TLSLic.edb from the directory  
5\. CLIENT - Go the client that has expired terminal evaluation period  
6\. CLIENT - Run registry editor  
7\. CLIENT - Go to the following key  
"HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\MSLicensing\\"  
8\. CLIENT - Note there are two subkey named "Store" and "HardwareID"  
9\. CLIENT - Delete both subkeys  
10\. DO NOT connect yet to the terminal server with the client!  
11\. SERVER - Change the date on the server to lets say year 2014 (this is used to  
change expiration day so you don't need to repeat following steps every 90 days)  
12\. SERVER - Start the terminal licensing service  
13\. CLIENT - Connect the client to the server  
14\. CLIENT - Note that windows recreated new key in  
"HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\MSLicensing\\". This new key holds new  
expiration date on year what you choose to licence expire.  
15\. SERVER - Go to the Terminal server licensing in Administrative Tools  
16\. SERVER - Note that temporary licence now expires on year 2014. Issue date is  
also at year 2014 but information is not importat for clients to function. Server just  
saves expiration date on client.  
17\. SERVER - Return date on server to today date  
18\. You have Terminal Licence that expires at date that is long in future :)

Can anyone confirm the PER USER mode for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP2? This worked great for Windows 2003 R2 SP2 and required NO HACKS or anything but of course you would be out of license compliance. Oh well, like MS is gonna come knocking at your door.  
  
I guess I could try it myself, change the time in the BIOS and OS, remove the network connection and see if it times out.  
  
If not the Term Serv hacks for 2008 should work fine too.

THERE IS AN EASIER (that works both with 2003 and 2008) WAY TO EXTEND THE GRACE PEDIOD (3 MONTH).  
  
\- set your BIOS date to 01 january 2030 (I have not tried other dates)  
\-install windows server 2008 R2 (disable its automatic updates)  
\-install terminal services by selecting "I will specify a licensing server in ...")  
\-using another computer, stablish your first connection to the terminal server you have just set up - a popup message will appear on the system tray of your server saying that you must specify a licensing server in 120 days DONT WORRY.)  
\-logoff your terminal services session  
\-login locally to your terminal server and set its to a current date (xx/xx/2010).  
\-restart your terminal server and set a current date to your BIOS.  
\-wait your terminal server to load and stablish another connection to it. You will see that initial message saying specify a licensing server in 120 days change to specify a licensing server in 7xxx days (the period from now to 2030 - a lot of years.  
  
TRUST ME... it works. there is no need for cracks or deleting terminal server databases.

I FORGOT ONE POINT  
of course you can turn on automatic updates again (but the steps described above have to be taken before updating your terminal server)

Thank you very much for kickin my ass to the right way... after a hour of useless talk to M$  
I had a bit different issue - properly activated w2k terminal server was serving for a couple years to 2k/xp pro clients. The problem came with a W7 home client after 90 days, deleting the license from client´s registry did not help.  
I have tried to stop TS licensing service, rename the %windir%\\system32\\lserver\\tlslic.edb and started the TS licencing service back, all above done through RDP session. The license server remained activated, the permanent license list was empty and the temporary license list had disappeared. XP and 2k clients with permanent license stored locally can access the server but their licenses are not visible in the license manager. After deleting the mentioned registry key they receive a new license visible in the license manager. Any client with expired temporary license can not get connected without deleting its registry key, sure.  
Many thanks to the others for the time warp patch too, if my home user wont upgrade his win I shall try it in next 90 days:)

Some tests are quick, while some are more accurate, and some are good at detecting recent substance consumption, while others detect it over a longer duration.Listed below are the four types of drug tests:This is the most common method of testing consumers for drugs. Health professionals will look for specific drug markers, along with creatinine, pH, temperature, and color. Now, in almost all cases, the urine must be provided at the site of the lab. Before starting with the effective methods, let’s first bust some myths regarding a hair follicle drug test. Although some of the options or hacks may look simple and viable, they usually do not help anyone pass the test. Visit: https://www.urineworld.com/
