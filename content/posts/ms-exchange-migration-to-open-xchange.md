MS Exchange is being used in the company I work for many years. It does the job, but it lacks flexibility when compared to most FOSS solutions and its back-end is known as not very robust. I'm working on a project to migrate from MS Exchange 2000 to Open-Xchange and I think my experience could help others in the same road.
