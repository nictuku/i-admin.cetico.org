David Mart√≠nez was kind enough to put up a repository of MySQL 4 and further dependencies compiled for FC2.

You may get the files directly from:

These packages fixed a very ugly behaviour I was getting with my mixed mysql lib's.  
Every time I ran a perl with a MySQL DBI, it ended with Segmentaion Fault.  
Now it's fine. Thanks David!
