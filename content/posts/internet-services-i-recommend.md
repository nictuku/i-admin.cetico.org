I'm a happy consumer of Internet services. Besides buying products from Amazon, iTunes, Google and other giants, I also subscribe to a bunch of small service providers that prove their competence and respect for consumers. It's only fair that I give them some praise and recommend their services to whoever might find this post.  
  

*   [rsync.net is a remote storage site that provides flexible data access like SSH, WebDAV and obviously rsync](http://www.rsync.net/). They are a bit pricy but offer nice features like Git support. The problem is I can't use them to backup all of my MP3 bought from iTunes and Amazon, because of their price. And I've been using github.com for private git repositories, so I'll probably cancel my subscription with rsync.net sometime soon. I'm still looking for another cheap per-byte general purpose backup provider. This is a commodity service and features are not \*that\* important. So there is a chance I'll be stuck with Amazon S3 or Google Docs (which doesn't support access to upload via API, unless you are a premium subscriber or something).
*   [github.com is a Git hosting site](http://www.github.com/). All cool kids are using GitHub. These guys really know what their are doing. The UI is very well polished and they know what developers need, which is evident from recent feature additions such as the [Pull Request 2.0](http://github.com/blog/712-pull-requests-2-0). They offer free hosting for open source projects and you can pay a small fee for private repositories.
*   [rimuhosting.com](http://rimuhosting.com/) offers Linux virtual private servers. I've been a customer for a long time and worked for them as a Linux tech guy for about a year. Their prices are a bit high but their support really kick-ass. If you are afraid you might brake your system during an upgrade and need some help to fix it, or may get stuck setting up a mail server, RimuHosting is for you.

I'll add more stuff to this list as I remember about them.
