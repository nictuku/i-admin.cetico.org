I needed updated squid packages last week for the security issue with ntlm\_auth. That was several days after the bug was disclosed.  
  
They didn't have that ready.  
  
Just please notice that I am talking about the Fedora Legacy here, not Fedora Core.  
  
Anyway, I am still too see a distro that make patches and publishes them as fast as Debian.
