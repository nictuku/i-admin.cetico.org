Google will launch tomorrow its instant messaging service.  
  
You can connect to it using any Jabber full client for Windows, like Gaim or Exodus (I could not make it work with Miranda, a great client).  
  
You need to setup the following:  
  
Server: talk.google.com  
User: youremail@gmail.com (with the domain part)  
password: yourpass  
port 5222  
  
Add me if you want :-) yves.junqueira@gmail.com
