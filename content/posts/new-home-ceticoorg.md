Great. As GoDaddy's prices are so low, I've decided to pay for a web hosting (so cheap!) and host this blog there.  
  
Unfortunately I've lost my old site's layout, so I'll have to start that from stratch. Argh. It's so painful to draw web sites. I'll see if Macromedia can give me hand (Fireworks, Dreamweaver, etc).
