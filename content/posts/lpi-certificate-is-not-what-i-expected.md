Last friday I got my LPIC Level 1.  
  
They sent the certificate itself, an id card asserting "John Doe" is a certified LPIC Level 1 professional and an ad from linux-magazine.com.  
  
The certificate paper is cheap, too thin IMO. I thought Canada was the land of wood and paper :) Good quality paper shouldn't be so expensive there. And I paid 200 hundred dollars for that.  
  
Also, it's bad propaganda since it sais I have a "\[b\]Level 1\[b\]" cert in big capitalized words. The unaware will underestimate my knowledges hehe.
