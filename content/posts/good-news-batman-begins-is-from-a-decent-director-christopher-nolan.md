Batman Begins, the next movie about Batman to be released soon, was directed by Christopher Nolan, the director of Memento, which was a really great movie, and Insomnia.  
  
Although it can be better than those terrible prequels, we shouldn't not expect the quality of Tim Burton's now classics Batman and Batman Returns.
