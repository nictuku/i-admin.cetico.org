A good anti-spam solution must have at least two approaches:  
  
An RBL check, and a learning tool of some sort.  
  
When deploying an RBL check solution, one must note that the lists should be picked carefuly, since they could block HAM either.  
  
It is important to implement exceptions lists, either, in order to ignore some key entries in the lists (murphy.debian.org, for example).  
  
About the learning tool, this will the topic for a future post.
